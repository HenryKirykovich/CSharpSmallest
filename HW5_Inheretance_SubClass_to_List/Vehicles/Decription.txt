Start a new Visual Studio console project, call it Vehicles

[1] Add a new class called Vehicle (you can add it in the same file as class Program, just don’t put it INSIDE of class Program

   >> Edit the Vehicle class and add a string property called Color and an int property called Weight
   >>  Add a virtual Print method, which takes no parameter, and writes out “Hi from the parent print”.

[2] Now add another new class, called Car, it should inherit from the Vehicle class.
         >> Give it an int Property called Mileage. (How many miles per gallon of gas it gets.)
         >> Give it a Print method, which overrides the parent’s Print method. This Print method should print out a message that says:
“The color of this car is color, it weighs x, and it gets z miles per gallon”        
Where the value of color comes from its Color prop, the value of x comes from its Weight prop, and the z value comes from the Mileage property.
       >> provide a 3 argument constructor so the user can create an object and set all 3 properties with the one call to the constructor.

[3] Now add another new class, called Truck, it should inherit from the Vehicle class.
         >> Give it an int Property called GVW.  (Stands for gross vehicle weight)
         >> Give it a Print method, which overrides the parent’s Print method. This Print method should print out a message that says:
“The color of this truck is color, it weighs x, and it can carry z pounds.”        
Where the value of color comes from its Color prop, the value of x comes from its Weight prop, and the z value comes from the GVW property.
       >> provide a 3 argument constructor so the user can create an object and set all 3 properties with the one call to the constructor.


[4] Now add another new class, called Motorcycle, it should inherit from the Vehicle class.
         >> Give it an int Property called Displacement.  (This is a measure of engine size, typically between 100 and 1500.)
         >> Give it a Print method, which overrides the parent’s Print method. This Print method should print out a message that says:
“The color of this motorcycle is color, it weighs x, and its engine is z cc.”        
Where the value of color comes from its Color prop, the value of x comes from its Weight prop, and the z value comes from the Displacement property.
       >> provide a 3 argument constructor so the user can create an object and set all 3 properties with the one call to the constructor.




[4] Now in the Main method of your program.cs, instantiate 6 objects (2 objects of type Car, 2 objects of type Truck, and 2 objects of type Motorcycle).

[5] Create a new List<t> of type Vehicle, and add your 6 objects to the List.

[6] Using a foreach loop, call the Print method for each of the objects in the List.
