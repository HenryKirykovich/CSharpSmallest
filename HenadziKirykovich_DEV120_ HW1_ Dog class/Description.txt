start a project new console project

at the end of the Program class, add a new class definition named Dog

In there

   (1) create a string property for breed

   (2) create an int  property for weight

Then back in your Program  Main method

   (3) create 2 instances of Dog objects

   (4) set each of their 2 properties

(5) then write those values out to the console with lines that should look like

Dog1 is a Collie and weighs 42 pounds
Dog2 is a Springer and weighs 28 pounds


(You Dog class does not need a constructor, but if you are feeling
adventurous, write one and then use it.)
